            The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal
            program that allows recipients to easily purchase food at many
            grocery stores and farmers markets through an Electronic Benefit
            Transfer (EBT) card.

          <p className="text-gray-800 mb-6">
            Many students don't know they are eligible to apply for SNAP, a
            crucial resource for those facing food insecurity. SNAP for Students
            aims to increase awareness about eligibility requirements for the
            program.
